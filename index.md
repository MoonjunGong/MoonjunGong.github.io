## About Me

I received my bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications(BUPT)](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/). During May 2024 - Nov 2024, I worked as a research assistant in [MARS LAB](http://group.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~marslab/#/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), working under the supervision of [Prof. Hang Zhao](https://hangzhaomit.github.io/). I was a research student in [AI4CE LAB](https://ai4ce.github.io/) at [New York University(NYU)](https://www.nyu.edu/), working with [Yiming Li](https://yimingli-page.github.io/), advised by [Prof. Chen Feng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YeG8ZM0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) from Mar.2023 to May 2024. Before this, I was a research student in COST LAB at BUPT from Mar.2022 to Mar.2023, advised by Prof. Jianqin Yin.

## Research Interests


My primary research goal is to enable autonomous robots to perceive and interact with the physical world at a human level, ultimately creating positive societal impact across diverse communities. 

My previous works on autonomous driving has provided me with a strong foundation in tackling complex
perception tasks, developing novel algorithms, and managing large-scale datasets. Additionally,
my research on Gaussian Splatting in large-scale and dynamic scenes has allowed me
to address the unique challenges of modeling dynamic driving data.

Looking ahead, a key area I aim to explore is explainable, generalizable, and robust representation
learning. I believe that generalizable and robust
representations are essential for enabling machines to perceive and reason about the physical
world from first principles, much like humans do. Moreover, explainability is crucial—not only
for interpreting these models’ internal processes but also for ensuring their safety and
trustworthiness in critical applications.

I am also intrigued by collaborative autonomous intelligence, as it allows autonomous robots to share and validate perception results and extend their perception range, which has the potential to significantly enhance the robustness and accuracy of the entire system.

In conclusion, my research interests are as follows: 

- **Robotics:** Perception and Planning
- **Computer Vision:** Neural Radience Fields, Gaussian Splatting, 3D Scene Understanding, Collaborative Perception and Prediction
- **Machine Learning:** Explainable, Generalizable and Robust Representation Learning

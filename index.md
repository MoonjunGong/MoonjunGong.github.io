## About Me

I am a senior undergraduate student at [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications(BUPT)](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/). I have been a research student in [AI4CE LAB](https://ai4ce.github.io/) at [New York University(NYU)](https://www.nyu.edu/), working with [Yiming Li](https://roboticsyimingli.github.io/), advised by [Prof. Chen Feng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YeG8ZM0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) since Mar.2023. Before this, I was a research student in COST LAB at BUPT from Mar.2022 to Mar.2023, advised by Prof. Jianqin Yin.

## Research Interests

I am passionate about computer vision and its application to robotics, with a focus on enhancing robots' perception and planning abilities. Previously, I curated large-scale datasets to support the development of reliable algorithms. Moving forward, I aim to develop perception algorithms that can generalize effectively across diverse datasets with varying settings. This adaptability is crucial for the widespread adoption of autonomous systems. I am also intrigued by collaborative autonomous intelligence and planning algorithms that integrate multiple autonomous systems for seamless and efficient teamwork.

In conclusion, my research interests are as follows: 

- **Robitics:** Perception and Planning
- **Computer Vision:** 3D Scene Understanding, Collaborative Perception and Prediction
- **Machine Learning:** Robust and Efficient Algorithms

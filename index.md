## About Me

I am a senior undergraduate student at [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications(BUPT)](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/). I have been a research student in [AI4CE LAB](https://ai4ce.github.io/) at [New York University(NYU)](https://www.nyu.edu/), working with [Yiming Li](https://roboticsyimingli.github.io/), advised by [Prof. Chen Feng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YeG8ZM0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) since Mar.2023. Before this, I was a research student in COST LAB at BUPT from Mar.2022 to Mar.2023, advised by Prof. Jianqin Yin.

## Research Interests

My research interests lie in the field of computer vision, with a specific focus on its application to autonomous driving. I am dedicated to advancing the capabilities of autonomous vehicles by enhancing their ability to accurately perceive the surrounding world and make precise planning decisions. In my previous work, I have devoted significant efforts to curating large-scale datasets that serve as valuable resources for the development of robust and reliable perception and prediction algorithms. 

Moving forward, my goal is to further contribute to the field by developing robust perception algorithms that can effectively generalize across datasets with varying settings. I believe that the ability to adapt and perform well in diverse environments is essential for the widespread adoption of autonomous driving technology. Additionally, I am deeply intrigued by the potential of collaborative autonomous intelligence. I am eager to explore and contribute to projects that involve the integration of multiple autonomous systems, enabling them to work together seamlessly and efficiently. 

In conclusion, my research interests are as follows: 

- **Computer Vision:** 3D Scene Understanding, Collaborative Perception and Prediction
